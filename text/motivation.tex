    \begin{block}{What is Robustness in Deep Learning?}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item DNNs are easily fooled by perturbations.
            
            \item Lack of robustness hinders application in safety critical environments (e.g. healthcare).
            
            \item Several solutions have been proposed. \footnote[frame]{\fullcite{causalView}}
